                <p>Himalayan Java Barista Coffee School was introduced to promote the culture of vocational training in Nepal.

                    We believe vocational training helps individuals to understand the essential elements of a particular course without wasting much time or energy, compared to a full-fledged university degree. We also believe that vocational training is the backbone of all developing countries.</p>
